    Raises:
        ValueError: If text is empty or model_name is invalid
        ModelNotFoundError: If specified model is not available
        
    Example:
        Basic usage:
        >>> sentiment = analyze_sentiment("I love this tutorial!")
        >>> print(sentiment)
        'positive'
        
        With confidence score:
        >>> sentiment, confidence = analyze_sentiment(
        ...     "This is okay", 
        ...     return_confidence=True
        ... )
        >>> print(f"{sentiment} ({confidence:.2f})")
        'neutral (0.65)'
        
        Using different models:
